Federal agencies include those with responsibilities over activities in the Mississippi River and its basin, and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Plan has a near-term target of reducing nutrient-loading to the Gulf of Mexico from the basin by 20 percent by 2025, and a long-term goal of limiting the Gulf hypoxic zone to an average annual size of less than 5,000 square kilometers by 2035.

According to the program's website, ""through improved water quality, communities across the basin will benefit from safer drinking water, protected fisheries, and a more stable economy. Partnerships will provide farmers and urban communities with a more resilient landscape and improved local water quality as they have the support they need to implement watershed plans and expand business plans to include conservation systems.""

Y,2023,EPA,Water,"Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds",Geographic Programs - Southeast New England Coastal Watershed Restoration Program,"The mission of this program is to foster collaboration among regional partners across southeast New England's coastal watersheds to protect and restore water quality, ecological health, and diverse habitats by sharing knowledge and resources, promoting innovative approaches, and leveraging economic and environmental investments to meet the needs of current and future generations. By 2050, we envision a resilient ecosystem of safe and healthy waters, thriving watersheds and natural lands, and sustainable communities throughout southeast New England's coastal watersheds.

Eligible Uses: Ecosystem and wetland restoration, stormwater treatment and control, nature-based infrastructure, community resilience, resilient shorelines, and environmental education.

According to the program website, this program will engage stakeholders to develop an overall planning framework and action agenda that builds on and complements the planning and implementation capacities of the numerous entities engaged in this area. The Program will foster effective coordination among the numerous entities working to restore coastal watersheds, rationalize disparate funding sources, and implement targeted restoration projects that address regionally significant priorities.

Y,2023,EPA,Water,"Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds",Gulf Hypoxia,"The Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force includes Federal and State agencies and the Tribes. Federal agencies include those with responsibilities over activities in the Mississippi River and its basin, and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Plan has a near-term target of reducing nutrient-loading to the Gulf of Mexico from the basin by 20 percent by 2025, and a long-term goal of limiting the Gulf hypoxic zone to an average annual size of less than 5,000 square kilometers by 2035.

According to the program's website, ""through improved water quality, communities across the basin will benefit from safer drinking water, protected fisheries, and a more stable economy. Partnerships will provide farmers and urban communities with a more resilient landscape and improved local water quality as they have the support they need to implement watershed plans and expand business plans to include conservation systems.""
