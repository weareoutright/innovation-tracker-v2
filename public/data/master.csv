According to the FY24 Budget Justification, in FY22 funding for this program was allocated across three primary areas: (1) Construction of captive bird propagation facilities for endangered bird species in Hawaii; (2) Landscape level biological control to reduce mosquito vector that causes avian malaria; (3) Supported the American the Beautiful Challenge, providing $70 million in FY 2022 (with an additional $10 million in FY 2023, for a total of $80 million) to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), that support locally led ecosystem restoration projects that invest in watershed restoration, resilience, equitable access, workforce development, corridors and connectivity, and collaborative conservation. Awards to 55 grantees were announced November 2022.

According to the FY23 Budget Justification, the estimated funding for FY22 was only 72,620,500. The FY24 Budget Justification states that the FY22 Actual funding was $76,500,000.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Y,2021,DOI,Office of the Secretary Department-Wide Programs,,"Orphaned Well Site Plugging, Remediation, and Restoration","Funding to administer a program for plugging wells on Federal land, and for issuing grants to States and Tribes on State, private, and Tribal land. Grants to States are available through three separate programs. Initial Grants: Either $5 million or up to $25 million to each qualifying State that applies before May 14, 2022. Funding unobligated after 1 year must be returned. Formula Grants: $2 billion in total funding available to States that submitted a Notice of Intent to the Department of the Interior by December 30, 2021. The amount each State is eligible for under this program is determined by formula. Funding unobligated after 5 years must be returned. Performance Grants: $1.5 billion in discretionary grants to States that increase their own spending on well plugging, remediation, and reclamation, or improve the regulation of oil and gas wells within the State.

According to the IIJA WHGB, eligible uses for funding are: Inventory, site characterization, down-hole well plugging, surface remediation, removal of surface equipment, restoration of native species habitat impacted by orphaned wells and associated infrastructure, measurement and tracking of air and water pollution due to orphaned wells, and identification and remediation of disproportionate health and environmental impacts of orphaned wells on communities of color, low-income communities, and Tribal and indigenous communities.

The FY24 Budget Justification further breaks program funding down by Federal Program, Grant Program, and Other Activities and includes detailed information on program activities in FY22, including a table showing how many wells were plugged in each state.

According to the FY24 Budget Justification, funds may be available via agreements or contracts for “authorized restoration services” which include forest, rangeland, and watershed restoration services. ‘‘Good Neighbor Agreements’’ are cooperative agreements or contracts entered between the Federal government and a State, County, or Tribe to carry out authorized restoration services, allowing the US Forest Service and BLM to collaborate with these groups to plan and execute cross-jurisdictional restoration work.

In FY22, funded projects supported invasive species eradication in legacy disturbances, expansion of existing forestry agreements, wildlife habitat improvement, seasonal protections for wildlife and at-risk resources, and aquatic system restoration in areas impacted by legacy forest management. Also, BLM entered into a partnership with the Nevada Department of Wildlife, initiating a 5-year project to support up to $10 million in future work to restore wildlife habitat and reduce wildfire risk.

This program provides the American people with safe, multi-modal access to Federal and Tribal lands and addresses this former funding gap. Through effective transportation access to Federal lands, visitors can enjoy the recreational opportunities within these Federal estates. In doing so, they are contributing significantly to economic generation in rural America, particularly the small businesses that operate just outside Federal lands within gateway communities across the country. In addition to the $55M appropriated each year through FY26, there is $300M authorized to be appropriated to carry out section 1123 of the FAST Act (23 U.S.C. 201 note; Public Law 114–94) for each of FY22-FY26.

These significant transportation facilities also support access to clean energy sources, such as wind and solar farms on Federal lands, and frequently benefit transportation access in addition to conservation initiatives. An example is the selection of a project in Zion National Park that will result in the replacement of an aged, fossil fuel burning bus fleet with clean energy buses including electric vehicle charging stations.

According to the FY24 Budget Justification, in FY22, ""Water Sanitation and Other Facilities"" activities included announcing, awarding, and initiating three projects, totaling $10.65 million of BIL funding, to address water systems with compliance violations or critical risks of system failure. Also, for ""Dam Safety"", BIL funding in FY22 advanced rehabilitation designs for select dams and allocated partial construction funds to one dam project.

In the budget documents, this program is divided into ""Water Sanitation and Other Facilities"" and ""Dam Safety,"" however in the IIJA WHGB it is listed on one page as one program, but it specifies in the description which activities fall under water sanitation and which fall under dam safety.

It is designed to support Tribes facing questions and decisions regarding managed retreat, expansion, protect-in-place, and relocation options due to threats from intensifying coastal or riverine erosion, flooding and permafrost degradation impacts, sea level rise, and other impacts. Assessment, monitoring, planning, design, and implementation (of actions identified in existing planning documents or with appropriate baseline data) are allowable. Activities should address climate change impacts which affect the viability of infrastructure and other resources at risk. Examples of planning activities can include vulnerability and risk assessments, design of expansion, protect-in-place or relocation activities; analysis of options; development of Tribal community mitigation efforts; design of emergency drills and exercises, and more.

According to the FY24 Budget Justification, in FY22 IIJA funding expanded the FY22 BIA Tribal Climate Resilience Annual Awards program by adding two new funding categories related to community relocation.
