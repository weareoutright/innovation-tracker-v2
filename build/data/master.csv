FIA analyzes survey data with the latest geospatial technologies, including remote sensing; produces annual and five-year data sets for each U.S. State; makes data available online; and offers analytical results through data summarization tools with standard and custom design and filtering (e.g., EVALIDator and DATIM), reporting tools that allow for creation and sharing of customized reports (e.g., My City’s Trees, FIA One-Click Report, and NRS-FIA 5-yr digital reports), and online interactive spatial tools for sharing analysis and visualizations (e.g., FIA Geospatial Showcase). These data are increasingly incorporated into forest carbon and greenhouse gas monitoring and modeling, used by landowners and non-profits to inform projects aiming to store additional carbon, and used by researchers and land managers to improve climate adaptation, biodiversity, and ecosystem benefits. FIA works extensively with state forestry agencies, universities, and other partners, leveraging one partner dollar for every six Federal dollars.

FIA continues to inform forest management to reduce fire risk. Through partnerships and other national and regional efforts, FIA supports Federal, State, local, and private land managers with authoritative information to aid management decisions. Contributions include the development and maintenance of LANDFIRE,a comprehensive set of geospatial data and resources that support cross-boundary fire planning, management, and operations; the development of TreeMap, a tree-level model of US forests used to reduce risks to wildfire responders and to inform scenario planning for hazardous fuels treatments; contributions to updating national risk maps with the Forest Service Forest Health Assessment and Applied Science Team; and the delivery and integration of forest inventory data with other tools such as the agency's Forest Vegetation Simulator.",17621,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These achievements were, in part, made possible by the using GNA, modernization for National Environmental Policy Act planning and forest products delivery, insect and disease designations, stewardship contracting, the Agriculture Conservation Experienced Services Program, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The agency will continue to prioritize the use of these authorities and take the necessary steps to increase its capacity to reach output goals in conjunction with its hazardous fuels reduction and strategic vegetation management work. The agency continues to grow relationships with State partners through the GNA program, which allows States to restore watersheds and manage forests on National Forest System lands through agreements or contracts. A total of 378 GNA agreements covering a variety of restoration activities are in place across 38 States, with 40 new agreements implemented in 2022. Timber harvesting under GNA continues to grow; 274 million board feet were sold in 2022 under this authority. The 2018 Farm Bill expanded GNA authority to allow counties and Tribes to participate in the program. There are currently 15 GNA agreements with counties and 15 with Tribes, working

The program secures and protects National Forest System lands and land interests through land surveys in advance of timber sales, acquiring rights-of-way, and administering road agreements necessary for public and agency access to complete activities, including timber production, transportation, recreation, and utility inspection. The program administers 74,000 lands related Special Use Authorizations, representing 18,000 miles of powerlines, 1,500 communication sites, 6,600 miles of pipeline, 2,000 reservoirs, 14,000 recreation residences, 250 hydropower projects, and 1,300 commercial filming and still photography projects. At roughly $150 million in annual revenue, the Special Use Program not only represents more than half the annual receipts within the entire agency, but they account for at least $100 billion of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. In 2022, the program increased investment in its national centralized billing team that has increased the agency's efficiency by reducing staff workload by 25 percent allowing them to work on other priority infrastructure and recreational projects. The team also reduced the time required to issue billing invoices by 25 percent as well. The industry standard for collections on account receivables older than 120 days should be less than 12 percent or approximately 90 percent efficient for high performing companies; however, the billing team’s efforts to increase on-line billing and other improvements have significantly increased the agency effectiveness in collecting fees by over 98 percent and improving overall internal and external customer service. Overall, the billing team collected $35.8 million in proceeds in 2022, an increase in gross permit receipts of over 13 percent, with thousands of Special Use Data System (SUDS) permit data errors corrected, and substantial support for regional digitization of both rights-of-way and easements. A key function of the program is permitting and managing authorizations for powerline facilities that cross National Forest System lands and connect to the national power grid, which ensures delivery of electricity to businesses and homes throughout the nation. Through the creation of new policy for review and approval of operating plans, the Forest Service can now provide timely and consistent responses to requests for routine vegetation management and maintenance work that reduces risks of power disruption and catastrophic wildfires. Under the policy, authorized officers have initiated communication with powerline operators to renew their permits, update operating plans and begin vegetation removal in priority areas. The program has also initiated regulatory changes that will allow permitting of carbon capture and storage projects, which will allow National Forest System lands to be used for reducing and offsetting the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. In 2024, the program will continue investing in creating a diverse and responsive staff that represents and serves the American public through expansion of rural broadband, reduction of wildfire threats near powerlines, and consideration for carbon capture and storage projects.",6934,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The program administers 74,000 lands related Special Use Authorizations, representing 18,000 miles of powerlines, 1,500 communication sites, 6,600 miles of pipeline, 2,000 reservoirs, 14,000 recreation residences, 250 hydropower projects, and 1,300 commercial filming and still photography projects. At roughly $150 million in annual revenue, the Special Use Program not only represents more than half the annual receipts within the entire agency, but they account for at least $100 billion of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. In 2022, the program increased investment in its national centralized billing team that has increased the agency's efficiency by reducing staff workload by 25 percent allowing them to work on other priority infrastructure and recreational projects. The team also reduced the time required to issue billing invoices by 25 percent as well. The industry standard for collections on account receivables older than 120 days should be less than 12 percent or approximately 90 percent efficient for high performing companies; however, the billing team’s efforts to increase on-line billing and other improvements have significantly increased the agency effectiveness in collecting fees by over 98 percent and improving overall internal and external customer service. Overall, the billing team collected $35.8 million in proceeds in 2022, an increase in gross permit receipts of over 13 percent, with thousands of Special Use Data System (SUDS) permit data errors corrected, and substantial support for regional digitization of both rights-of-way and easements. A key function of the program is permitting and managing authorizations for powerline facilities that cross National Forest System lands and connect to the national power grid, which ensures delivery of electricity to businesses and homes throughout the nation. Through the creation of new policy for review and approval of operating plans, the Forest Service can now provide timely and consistent responses to requests for routine vegetation management and maintenance work that reduces risks of power disruption and catastrophic wildfires. Under the policy, authorized officers have initiated communication with powerline operators to renew their permits, update operating plans and begin vegetation removal in priority areas. The program has also initiated regulatory changes that will allow permitting of carbon capture and storage projects, which will allow National Forest System lands to be used for reducing and offsetting the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere.

FIA analyzes survey data with the latest geospatial technologies, including remote sensing; produces annual and five-year data sets for each U.S. State; makes data available online; and offers analytical results through data summarization tools with standard and custom design and filtering (e.g., EVALIDator and DATIM), reporting tools that allow for creation and sharing of customized reports (e.g., My City’s Trees, FIA One-Click Report, and NRS-FIA 5-yr digital reports), and online interactive spatial tools for sharing analysis and visualizations (e.g., FIA Geospatial Showcase). These data are increasingly incorporated into forest carbon and greenhouse gas monitoring and modeling, used by landowners and non-profits to inform projects aiming to store additional carbon, and used by researchers and land managers to improve climate adaptation, biodiversity, and ecosystem benefits. FIA works extensively with state forestry agencies, universities, and other partners, leveraging one partner dollar for every six Federal dollars.

FIA continues to inform forest management to reduce fire risk.

• Administering livestock grazing use on approximately 74 million acres of the National Forest System lands. Grazing use is administered through a grazing permit system and includes processing, issuing, and overseeing compliance with grazing permits. The Forest Service administers permits for approximately 6,000 permittees associated with nearly 7,200 allotments across 28 states.
• Completing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis on grazing allotments with the priority and timing for completing each required environmental analysis determined in accordance with the provision at 43 U.S.C. 1752(i) (i.e., the environmental significance of the grazing allotment and the available funding for the environmental analysis), along with the subsequent implementation of management practices derived from NEPA decisions.
• Strategic investments and efforts for the maintenance and improvement of rangeland ecosystems. Of the 193 million acres of National Forest System lands, approximately 96 million acres are rangelands and includes areas outside of permitted grazing allotments. Rangeland management efforts include a variety of actions from instillation of structural rangeland improvements (e.g., water developments) to enhance livestock distribution to completion of nonstructural rangeland improvements (e.g., seedings, woody encroachment reduction) that benefit such things as carbon sequestration, fuels reduction and wildlife habitat improvement.

The program secures and protects National Forest System lands and land interests through land surveys in advance of timber sales, acquiring rights-of-way, and administering road agreements necessary for public and agency access to complete activities, including timber production, transportation, recreation, and utility inspection. The program administers 74,000 lands related Special Use Authorizations, representing 18,000 miles of powerlines, 1,500 communication sites, 6,600 miles of pipeline, 2,000 reservoirs, 14,000 recreation residences, 250 hydropower projects, and 1,300 commercial filming and still photography projects. At roughly $150 million in annual revenue, the Special Use Program not only represents more than half the annual receipts within the entire agency, but they account for at least $100 billion of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product. In 2022, the program increased investment in its national centralized billing team that has increased the agency's efficiency by reducing staff workload by 25 percent allowing them to work on other priority infrastructure and recreational projects. The team also reduced the time required to issue billing invoices by 25 percent as well. The industry standard for collections on account receivables older than 120 days should be less than 12 percent or approximately 90 percent efficient for high performing companies; however, the billing team’s efforts to increase on-line billing and other improvements have significantly increased the agency effectiveness in collecting fees by over 98 percent and improving overall internal and external customer service. Overall, the billing team collected $35.8 million in proceeds in 2022, an increase in gross permit receipts of over 13 percent, with thousands of Special Use Data System (SUDS) permit data errors corrected, and substantial support for regional digitization of both rights-of-way and easements. A key function of the program is permitting and managing authorizations for powerline facilities that cross National Forest System lands and connect to the national power grid, which ensures delivery of electricity to businesses and homes throughout the nation. Through the creation of new policy for review and approval of operating plans, the Forest Service can now provide timely and consistent responses to requests for routine vegetation management and maintenance work that reduces risks of power disruption and catastrophic wildfires. Under the policy, authorized officers have initiated communication with powerline operators to renew their permits, update operating plans and begin vegetation removal in priority areas. The program has also initiated regulatory changes that will allow permitting of carbon capture and storage projects, which will allow National Forest System lands to be used for reducing and offsetting the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. In 2024, the program will continue investing in creating a diverse and responsive staff that represents and serves the American public through expansion of rural broadband, reduction of wildfire threats near powerlines, and consideration for carbon capture and storage projects.",8000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
